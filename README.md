## 🌟 About  
This repository is a collection of basic algorithms (like sum, search, sort, etc.), implemented in **unexpectedly smart ways**.  
Not bloated. Not over-engineered. Just ✨ *elegant logic*.  

- 🧮 From a simple **sum** function that makes you say *"genius"*  
- 🔍 Search techniques that feel like *sorcery*  
- 🌀 Sorting with patterns you’ll want to copy & paste everywhere  

As we say: *"La simplicité est la sophistication suprême."* — Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
